r31: link register
r30: stack pointer

r8, r9, r10: used by the compiler for spilled registers; can be treated as
general caller save registers by asm.

r0..r7: args/caller save
r8..r10: caller save
r11..r29: callee save

r0 is the return value of the function


When entering a function, r30 should point to the earliest available
part of the stack.

Any arguments that didn't fit in registers are before it in the stack,
so *(r31-4) is the last argument in every case.

So, if we call f(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13), we'll call with:

r0=1, r1=2, ..., r7=8.

The stack will look like:

... 9 10 11 12 13

with r30 pointing just after the 13. The function being called will almost
certainly want to store r31 at the address pointed to by r30.
