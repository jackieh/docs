This file documents the format for Moroso debugging symbol files.

Files start with a 4-byte magic marker "MROD", followed by sections
identified by their own four-byte markers. All multi-byte integers
are big endian.

Currently, "LBEL" (label offsets) is the only section type; others will be
added later.


Label section (LBEL):
4-byte magic "LBEL"
4-byte count of the number of entries in the section
The entries themselves, consisting of:
  4-byte packet offset (in general, memory address / 0x10)
  4-byte label name length, including trailing NUL
  Label name, as a string, with a null terminator.
