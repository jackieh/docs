We use some dead simple file formats:

(All numbers and sizes and addresses are 4 bytes, little endian.)

The Moroso BS executable format:
* First, there is a header:
 * Magic number: "MROE" (for 'MoRosO Executable')
 * Number of bytes of data following the header
 * Size of region to map for executable
 * Base address to load the executable at
 * Entry point address
* Then, the actual executable data

The size of region to map may be larger than the amount of data in
order to support a .bss region.


The Moroso BSFS format:
* First, a header:
 * Magic number: "MROF" (for 'MoRosO Filesystem)
 * num_files, the number of files in the file system
* Then, a file table with num_files file table entries:
 * Offset that the file starts at
 * Size of the file
 * 40 character file name field - null terminated
   (This sucks but I don't care; if this makes anybody /really/ mad I
    could change it.)
* Then, a bunch of data
