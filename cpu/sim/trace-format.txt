This describes the format for traces dumped by the cpu_sim.

For each packet:

[4 bytes] pc
[16 bytes] Actual packet contents
[6 bytes] Register read bitfield (MSB first.)
[6 bytes] Register write bitfield
[1 byte] number of writes (redundant with the write bitfield, but makes it easier
                           to parse.)
[(0-4) * 4 bytes] Register write values. For each bit set in the register write
                  bitfield, we'll have another entry here. Lower-indexed registers first.


For memory writes (in a separate file):
[4 bytes] pc (note: packets without writes are entirely excluded here.)
[1 byte] first memory access type
  bit 1-0: width
  bit 2: 1 = write; 0 = read
  bit 3: 1 = present; 0 = not present
[1 byte] second memory access type
[4 bytes, optional] virtual address 1
[4 bytes, optional] value 1 (if write)
[4 bytes, optional] virtual address 2
[4 bytes, optional] value 2 (if write)
